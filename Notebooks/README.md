# Linear Regression Project

Project Description:
The objective of this project is to find an open dataset on kaggle or other website that comes with at least 2 numeric variables, at least 2 categorical variables and at least 100 observations. Then one target variable will be chosen as the outcome response by performing regression analysis using the data

Here I am using dataset from kaggle where the response variable is insurance cost incurred by the patients. The dataset has 7 columns including the response variable. The other 6 columns are used in analyzing the response variable i.e ‘charges’

The following is the metadata of the dataset.

a) age: age of primary beneficiary

b) sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

c) bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

d) children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number ofdependents

e) smoker: Smoking

f) region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

g) charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

Research Question and Summary
The question I wish to answer is what are the important predictors in determining insurance charges billed by the health insurance company. I wish to see if a linear model can be built to reliably predict the insurance charges. If I can build this model, we also want to examine what possible associations exist between the aforementioned predictors and insurance charges
